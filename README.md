A game I initially created in 7DFPS, but continually expanded upon it. It currently sits as a first person platformer with some arcade-y elements thrown in where the player is trapped in an abandoned MMO set in a cyberpunk world. I'm currently wrapped up on other game dev projects, but I definitely want to get back to this at some point.
